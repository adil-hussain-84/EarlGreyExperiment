# About

This Xcode project demonstrates how to assert that a particular `UILabel` or `UIButton` (matched by its accessibility identifier) has a particular text with EarlGrey 1. See the [Main.storyboard](EarlGreyExperiment/Base.lproj/Main.storyboard) file for the declaration of the `UIButton` and see the test methods in the [EarlGreyExperimentTests.swift](EarlGreyExperimentTests/EarlGreyExperimentTests.swift) file for the assertions.
